#### The Staging Folder
This folder contains "stg_" prefixed models which are staging models from tables that were created in the RAW Database, specifically Zone 3 "_current" suffixed tables. These staging models read directly from the source table and should only perform light transformations on the data. It is a dbt best practice not to reference the source table directly from a bunch of downstream models and instead reference the staging model. The models in this folder are further subdivided into folders based on their business dimension. For example, all staging models that are related to orders go in the "orders" folder.
